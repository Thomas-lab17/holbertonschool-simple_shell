.TH SIMPLE_SHELL 1 "January 2026" "Holberton School" "User Commands Manual"
.SH NAME
simple_shell - minimal command interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ./hsh
.br
.B echo "command" | ./hsh
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B simple_shell
program is a minimal UNIX command interpreter.
It reads commands from standard input, parses them into a command name and arguments,
searches the command in the
.B PATH
environment variable when needed, and executes it in a child process.
.PP
If standard input is a terminal, it displays a prompt:
.IP
$
.PP
Command execution rules:
.IP
If the command contains a
.B /
character, it is treated as a direct path and executed if permitted.
.IP
Otherwise, the shell searches each directory listed in
.B PATH
and executes the first matching executable found.
.IP
Arguments are separated by spaces and tabs.
.PP
This shell does not implement advanced parsing (quotes, escapes, pipes, redirections, separators, variables, globbing).
.SH RETURN VALUE
The program returns
.B 0
on normal exit.
Commands are executed in a child process; this shell waits for the child to finish.
.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

/**
 * main - Example usage (interactive and non-interactive)
 *
 * Return: Always 0
 */
int main(void)
{
    /* Interactive example:
     * $ ./hsh
     * $ ls -l /tmp
     * $ /bin/echo hello world
     * (Ctrl-D to exit)
     */

    /* Non-interactive example:
     * $ echo "ls -la" | ./hsh
     */

    return (0);
}
.fi
.SH BUGS
This shell is intentionally minimal.
.PP
Limitations include:
.IP
No builtins (e.g. exit, env).
.IP
No support for quotes, escapes, pipes, redirections, command separators, or logical operators.
.IP
Error messages are basic (e.g. "Command not found") and may not match
.BR sh (1)
exactly.
